							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">My dear students,</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">At the outset, I wish to thank you for your interest in joining this institution and I welcome you to our website. As being young, I am fully aware of the aspirations and hopes of the youngsters. I deem it an honor to be at the helm of an institution that helps so many youth like you to achieve their heart's desire in entering the vocation of their choice. I wish to assure you that our predominant aim is to ensure that you build the foundation of your successful career in this institution.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">Modern education is all about preparing for the future. Here I am referring to educational standards that are in vogue all over the world. And with our country launching itself into the globalization process, it is quite likely that many of you will rub shoulders with the academic cream of the world and will find yourselves competing with the best among the best. In such a scenario, the realization is clear that the precious years immediately ahead need to be concentrated with productive activity. Every minute needs to be planned and accounted for. Every hour must be programmed to contribute to your preparation for the arduous but glorious days ahead. Each drop of sweat and each step of effort go towards conditioning you in every manner in order that you may surge ahead of others.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">At this point of time, I wish to reiterate two points the first being that in the light of what I have just mentioned, the institution will do all in its capacity to bring out the best in you. The second is that on your part, we would like you to supplement the efforts of the management by co-operating in its overall plan to establish the highest standards of academic excellence.</p>

							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">Welcome  to the  KC  college campus at Thane east.  Since its inception in  2001 it  has made remarkable progress in the field of technical teaching . The excellence in teaching and research comes with a committed  team  working relentlessly towards it   . The students are mentored  here in a very personalized and customized pattern keeping their strengths and weakness in mind. We believe that an individual‘s personality must not come in conflict with the environment and every one should engage technically with a free mind.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">Having freedom of choice is very essential to the well being of all. So we offer a host of technical and non technical events, workshops and opportunities to the students to understand and develop themselves as a person and as a technocrat.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">We at KC believe  in the motto of "technology for humanity". If our technical knowledge and advancements do not contribute in  improving our quality of life then it is of no use . So, to develop the Humane face of Technology  we ensure that our students are exposed through the various committees and events that we have. If on one side our students are engaged in IOT based research, health care projects, students are giving solution to national problems through participating in smart India Hackathon and drone‘s are made and flown in the campus then we also have equal number of events to stimulate their minds about the importance of green environment , sensitize them about the  importance of women safety and women freedom, develop their perspectives on the national and international issues of importance where their learning can offer a solution.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">We have a strong connection between the students, faculties and corporate. We have host of events in the form of KED talks, T talks where ideas gets exchanged, fuelling the young minds. The young aspiring entrepreneurs are making a mark by small but relevant success stories right from winning national championships to offering solutions to  neighborhood society . In line with our national mission of developing villages KC students and faculties have adopted a village “pimpri” in Thane district for developing it with our technical know how in the form of skill transfer programmes and women empowerment, ecology conservation.</p>

							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">I am experiencing surge complex emotions while writing this message to you. It makes me really proud to send this message to my promising engineering minds who really work very hard to make themselves best so that they can ably handle the challenges of the new millennium.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">But at the back of my mind what overwhelms me is the complex challenges of this new millennium, especially for engineering students. The pace of technological development is so fast that what is new today becomes obsolete the next day. The knowledge horizon has widened so much that there is an inevitable synthesis of different streams. You are no more just an engineer but a part of a completely complex social system that demands your engineering expertise to be all inclusive.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">Here lies the real challenge. You can no more work in isolation but you have to work, invent, innovate and create in a larger context now. Now you are not just an engineer but a multitasking and multidimensional individual who has to go along with so many entities to achieve a holistic growth; a growth that is inclusive and not exclusive. This is the demand of the present millennium. By being exclusive, we have caused a grave damage to our eco system, we have played havoc with our social structure. There is a mad rush after mindless irresponsible growth.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">Today I want you to wake up to the new reality; the new reality of holistic and inclusive growth. Growth that is healthy. We cannot create to kill but we have work to build. You cannot grow at the cost of others’ lives but you have to lead the life of co-existence. As an engineer, you will have to be an entrepreneur, an economist, an environmentalist and a socialist who works responsibly to contribute to each of these areas. Only then and then we can build a society where we can all coexist peacefully, help each other to survive and grow. This is the only way we can build a healthy society around us, a nation of healthy growth and a world of peaceful co-existence. These are my genuine feelings that I have communicated to you. This is how I see the world and this is the stark reality of the moment.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">I am proud of you as promising young citizens of our nation. You are our hope for tomorrow. In your success lies the future of the nation. Never ever waver from the righteous path. Success founded on unethical base always comes to a tragic end. We have hundreds and thousands of examples of unethical enterprises coming to a tragic end.</p>
							<p class="text-left align-marg" style="text-align: justify;">So, cheer up enterprising young men. All the best to you for a bright future of tomorrow.</p>
